# Issues and Fixes #

## OSX ##

  * Having trouble installing USB drivers for the DFU bootloader (Message says "libusb can't be installed on this computer" when running the setup package)
    * If you have used a program called zipeg, apparently it messes up packages, so try unzipping the installer with something else.
